## React App Dockerized
The app can also be run using the docker file provide. please do run docker build and after successful build, do docker run

## Improvisation/To-do's
If time permits:
-> Add additional unit tests to cover Weather Result component part of WeatherSearch tests
-> Additional validation on special characters on text fields.. However, that has been taken care rendering based on status code
-> Cosmetic changes (css) although app is responsive
-> API Key is added to the react environment varaible which is visible. But for enhanced security it can come from chart files which is more secure in production.


## Note
If any challenges running docker. please do it manually, install and run.
